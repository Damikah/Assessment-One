        They’re just made of a basic, cream craker-esque biscuit base, with a dollop of hardened, artificially-coloured, saccharine icing sugar on top.
        These little colorful biscuits or cookies (or both) are known as iced gems biscuits across the world or Biskut Ais Jem in Malay. 
        Some call them button biscuits. These little gems are highly popular in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, and other Southeast Asian countries (and perhaps other parts of Asia too). 
        They are originated in Great Britain.

        <li>Biscuit base: Whisk the butter and sugar until it turns fluffy and lightens in colour. This should take 1-2 minutes of mixing tops. You can do this in a stand mixer, but with such small amounts, it whips up in no time at all even if you do it by hand. Add in the egg yolk, and give it a quick whisk until it’s well-mixed. Then, add in the flour, baking powder, and salt, then fold it in until a smooth dough forms.</li>
        <li>Heat your oven to 170°C. Roll the dough out until about 5mm (roughly ¼ inch) thick, then using a 2cm (¾ inch) ring mould, stamp out little discs of dough and place them onto a lined baking tray. If you don’t have ring moulds, you can weigh out 4g portions of dough, roll them into little balls and lightly pinch them so they flatten out. Either way, once you’ve done that for all of the dough, bake them in the oven for 12-16 minutes, until they turn a nice shade of golden brown. When they’re done, take them out and let them cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Red dye: To get your natural red dye, juice your beetroot and add the lemon juice to it, then reduce it until a quarter of the liquid is left, and it becomes a thick syrup. If you don’t have a juicer, don’t fret. (I didn’t either.) You can use a blender to puree your beetroot together with the lemon juice until smooth. If you’re having difficulty blending it, add a few tablespoons of water to help it out. Strain the pureed beetroot through a fine sieve, and then reduce this over medium heat until only a quarter of the liquid is left.</li>
        <li>Green dye: For the green, cut up your pandan leaves into small, ½-inch chunks (a pair of scissors work best), and blend it in a blender together with 2-3 tablespoons of water. Then, strain the juice through a fine sieve. Your green dye is done!</li>
        <li>Royal icing: (This is best done in a stand mixer or using an electric whisk, but doing it by hand works too.) Whisk your egg whites on high until it turns foamy and soft peaks start to form, add in the icing sugar in 2-3 batches, whisking the mixture until smooth in between each addition. Continue whisking the icing for about 8-10 minutes, until it becomes glossy and really firm.</li>
        <li>Split your icing into three equal portions. Leave one plain, and add the red and green colouring to the other two. (You probably won’t use all of the colouring, just 1-2 teaspoons should do, but you can add more or less depending on your personal colour preferences!) Give it a good mix until the colours smooth out, and put them into piping bags with a seven-sided star nozzle (D7). Then, pipe a little dollop onto each biscuit base!</li>
        <li>Let the biscuits rest and the icing to firm up for at least an hour, after which you can relive all your childhood sugar rushes through them!</li>
